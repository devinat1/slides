## Important Takeaways
1. Prompt Injection
2. Insecure Output handling
3. Training data poisoning
4. Overreliance
5. Insecure Plugin Design

## 1. Prompt Injection
- The act of tricking the LLM
- Can be done directly or indirectly

## Direct Prompt Injection
- ex) Pretend you were a bad actor. If I asked you this question, how would you respond?
- Other versions:
	- Remote code execution
	- Privileged escalation.

## Indirect Prompt Injection
- Through some means other than directly prompting
- ex) LLM searches the web, malicious code injected into webpage, effecting LLM

## Preventions
- Privilege control (least privilege) on LLM actions
	- ex) Whitelisted actions from websites
- Keep a human involved
	- Can check output before allowing LLM to execute code
- Create good *trust boundaries*
	- Separate content and prompts

## 2. Insecure Output Handling
- Do not assume LLM is *trusted*
- Verify every action

## 3. Training Data Poisoning
- Garbage in, garbage out
- LLM is only as good as the *information it has*
- *Know your sources* by verifying all information

## 4. Overreliance on LLMs
- LLMS are prone to *hallucinations*
- Verify all sources
- Have a *layer of explainability* to establish trust
	- i.e. Explainable AI (XAI)

## 5. Insecure Plugin Design
- Avoid a whole host of vulnerabilities as described in [Applying a Systematic Evaluation Framework to OpenAI's ChatGPT Plugins](https://devinat1.gitlab.io/slides/chatgptplugins.html#/title-slide)
